# This is a clouds.yaml file, which can be used by OpenStack tools as a source
# of configuration on how to connect to a cloud. If this is your only cloud,
# just put this file in your current directory, ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml
# or in /etc/openstack, and tools like python-openstackclient will just work
# with no further config. (You will need to add your password to the auth section)
# Check the different authentication types here:
# https://docs.openstack.org/keystoneauth/latest/plugin-options.html
# If you have more than one cloud account, add the cloud entry to the clouds
# section of your existing file and you can refer to them by name with
# OS_CLOUD=openstack or --os-cloud=openstack
